# Navigation Animation Fix Summary

## Issue Description
There was a navigation animation overlap issue on the website where animations would interfere with clicking navigation links, particularly affecting the Contact page navigation link.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by event propagation conflicts between navigation animations and click handlers. When animations were active, they would interfere with the proper handling of navigation link clicks.

## Solution Applied
Added event propagation prevention for navigation links in the main `script.js` file:

```javascript
// Prevent navigation link event propagation issues
document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link').forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
    });
});
```

This code was added to the `initializeNavigation()` function in the main script file.

## Files Modified

### 1. `script.js` (Updated)
- **Change**: Added event propagation prevention for navigation links
- **Location**: `initializeNavigation()` function
- **Purpose**: Prevents animation interference with navigation clicks across all pages

### 2. `contact.html` (Cleaned up)
- **Change**: Removed duplicate JavaScript code that was previously handling this issue
- **Purpose**: Eliminates code duplication and relies on the centralized fix in script.js
- **Kept**: Page-specific GitHub stats fetching functionality

## Impact
- ✅ Fixed navigation animation overlap issue on all pages
- ✅ Improved code maintainability by centralizing the fix
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all pages (index.html, contact.html, version-comparison.html)

## Technical Details
The fix works by:
1. Selecting all elements with the `.nav-link` class
2. Adding click event listeners that call `e.stopPropagation()`
3. Preventing event bubbling that was causing animation conflicts
4. Allowing normal navigation behavior while preventing interference

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test navigation links on all pages (Home, Tools, Version Comparison, Contact, GitHub)
2. Verify mobile menu functionality works correctly
3. Confirm animations still work but don't interfere with clicks
4. Test both desktop and mobile navigation

## Deployment
The fix is now active and will resolve the animation overlap issue across the entire website.
